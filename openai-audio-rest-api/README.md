# macOS openAPI compatible speech backend

Attempt at making a python http backend that can use the macOS system `say` command and the excellent 3rd party `hear` command to use tts / stt features.

Unpublished prototype because the mp3 support is missing in macOS `say` command, and my perfectionism is unsatisfied if we need an ffmpeg dependency for this package.


## Use case:
Fast and decent quality voice features for open-webui and other applications that integrate with openAI speech api.

## Quickstart & Installation:

- install ffmpeg (`brew install ffmpeg`)
- install `hear` if you want to use the voice recognition functionality
- run the backend with `python main.py`

- Try it with curl:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8003/v1/audio/speech" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{
 "input": "Hello, this is a test of the text to speech system using ffmpeg for conversion.",
 "voice": "echo",
 "response_format": "mp3",
 "speed": 1.0
}' \
   --output test_speech.mp3

                                               ```

- Maps the OpenAI voice names to macOS voice names:



## TODO:
- [Â ] Ability to use the macOS voice names directly. Run `say --v="?"` on the machine running the server to get a list of voice names. They may contain spaces and parenthesis, that's fine.
